# Graphene

Graphene : 2-d building block for $sp^{2}$  carbon allotrpes. 
$sp^2$ : A carbon atom bound to three atoms and forms a flat trigonal or triangular arrangement with 120Â° angles between bonds.

# Graphene Phonon mode
![Single layere graphene(SLG) Phonon modes](./SLG%20phonon%20mode.jpg)
Graphene has two atoms per unit cell -> six normal modes are possible.(three vibration mode - transverse, longitudial, out-plane. 8 are possible but 2 are degenerated.) 
- $E_{2g}$ : transverse(longitudial) anti-symmetric mode
- $E_{1u}$ : transverse(longitudial) symmetric mode
- $A_{2u}$ : out-plane symmetric mode
- $B_{2g}$ : out-plane anti-symmetric mode
Here, only $E_{2g}$ phonons are Raman active. $B_{2g}$ is not raman active. (Others are not raman active but infrared active.)

![Raman Spectrum]()
- D peak ~1330cm ${}^{-1}$ : breathing modes of six-atoms rings and a **defeat** in a 
- G peak ~1577cm ${}^{-1}$ : high-frequency energy $E_{2g}$ phonon. Thus, it is a stretching C-C bonding. (low-frequency energy $E_{2g}$ phonon for C mode absence in SLG)
- 2D peak ~2685cm ${}^{-1}$ : overtone of D peak. It originates from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposited wave vectors. So no defects are required. -> always exist
- D + D ${}^{\prime}$ peak : ...?
- 2D ${}^{\prime}$ peak : overtone of D ${}^{\prime}$ peak. D ${}^{\prime}$ can be invisible. (why? defeats!)

# Defects
Defects in graphene can result in ...
- D peak appears. $\frac{I_{D}}{I_{G}}$ increases
- D ${}^{\prime}$ peak 
- peaks are broaden
- D + D ${}^{\prime}$ peak

# crystal size $L_{A}$
$\frac{I_{D}}{I_{G}} \simeq \frac{C}{L_{A}} \simeq \frac{145}{L_{D}^{2}}$ where $C \simeq 4.4$ nm is constant, $L_{D}$ is defect distance.
