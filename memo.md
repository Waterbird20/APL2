<!-- Raman spectroscopy was employed to observe the D and G bands. These bands are assigned to the trend of the out-of-plane breathing mode of the sp2 atom due to defects and E2g phonons at the centre of Brillion zone, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 [9]. The Raman spectrum ofthe GO revealed a D band at 1354 cm−1 with the intensity comparable to the G band at 1597 cm−1and is indicative of significant structural disorders due to the harsh oxidation condition in Hummer’s process. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands, ID/IG gives an insight into the reduction process by removing oxygen functional groups that create imperfections within the carbon basal plane and can be related to the in-plane sp2 crystallite size, La [4]. A low ID/IG ratio shows an increase of the La due to the disorder associated with oxygen functional groups being diminished [13]. Due to the harsh oxidation employed from Hummer’s method, the D band increases dramatically which gives a high ID/IG ratio of 0.94. This value is close when compared with the GO obtained from Ganguly et al. [13] and Wang et al. [7]. After reduction,the ID/IG ratio for the rGO-P20, rGO-P40, rGO-F50 and rGO-F20 were 0.89, 0.84, 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. By employing the relation of the ID/IG ratio and La proposed by Tuinstra and Koening the in-plane sp2 crystallite size was determined using the equation 1/La = 4.4 (ID/IG) [14]. An increase in the La from 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.2 and 5.4 nm for the GO, rGO-F50, rGO-P20, rGO-P40 and rGO-F20 samples was observed. This is in good agreement with the decrease of the ID/IG ratio as well as a slightly increase in the La, which indicates that the hydrogen plasma is capable of removing the oxygen functional groups while restoring the sp2 C=C bonds -->
